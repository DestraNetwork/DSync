# Technical Description

## Overview
The DestraNetwork (DSync) smart contract is designed to handle tokenomics, fee management, and automated liquidity operations securely and efficiently.

## Architecture
### 1. **Contract Structure**
- **DestraNetwork.sol:** The main contract file containing the token logic, fee distribution, blacklisting mechanism, and swap back mechanism.
- **Libraries:**
  - `Address`: Handles address-related functions such as checking if an address is a contract and sending ETH.
  - `Context`: Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction.
- **Interfaces:**
  - `IERC20`: Defines the standard functions and events that an ERC20 token contract must implement.
  - `IDEXFactory`: Interface for interacting with the DEX factory, mainly used to create token pairs.
  - `IDEXRouter`: Interface for interacting with the DEX router, used for liquidity management and token swaps.
- **Abstract Contracts:**
  - `Ownable`: Provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an owner account that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.

### 2. **Key Components**
- **Tokenomics:**
  - Total supply is set at 1 billion DSync tokens.
  - Buy/sell transaction limits and wallet size restrictions are implemented to prevent price manipulation.

- **Fee Mechanism:**
  - The contract supports configurable fees for marketing and liquidity.
  - Fees are distributed upon every transfer, and a portion is swapped to ETH.

- **Swap Back Mechanism:**
  - The contract automatically swaps a portion of the tokens held by the contract to ETH.
  - Marketing and Liquidity fee is distributed using the swapped ETH.

### 3. **Security Considerations**
- **Reentrancy Protection:** Key functions are protected from reentrancy attacks by using the `swapping` modifier.
- **Access Control:** Only the contract owner or designated team members can perform critical operations like blacklisting or adjusting fees.
- **Zero Address Protection:** Transfers to the zero address are prevented.

## Development Tools
- **Solidity Compiler Version:** 0.8.17
- **Testing Framework:** Hardhat
- **Deployment:** Hardhat with custom scripts for deployment on different networks.
